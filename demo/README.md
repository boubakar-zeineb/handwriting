# Demo Deployment for Handwriting

For a demo you can visit this link : https://libretrend-2657f.firebaseapp.com/
The project is deployed on firebase.
The handwriting.io have problem on the website, we can't use the api so you will be unauthorized maybe.
Did all my best for this project to generate something.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Usage

I got the local authorization by connecting to Advanced rest client and launched an example of the request , so he will ask for username and passeword which are : `auth = ("ZXJBZKBPC1MPNKRC", "Y2K113M9SYN18JTM")` , they are public.

## Templating

For the design , [PRIME NG](https://www.primefaces.org/) is used with bootstrap 4 and font-awesome, because it contains a lot of components flexible and usefull tools.
